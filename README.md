# Netflix-dashboard-using-Tableau

I created an impressive Netflix dashboard in Tableau using a dataset that contains over 6k rows of data and 12 different fields related to TV shows and movies. I demonstrated how to visualize the count of TV shows and movies by date, create an interactive map showcasing the number of movies released by country, and generate a chart displaying the percentage and total of movies or TV shows by type.

Furthermore, I added a filter feature to view the description, duration, and rating of individual movies or TV shows, and showed viewers how to format the dashboard layout for a more polished and professional look. To top it off, I included the iconic Netflix logo to give it that authentic feel. Overall, I showcased my Tableau skills by creating a stunning and informative Netflix dashboard that's sure to impress!
